Additional functions
1 - showing the miliseconds
To demonstrate this function, we had to create another clock at 10hz. From there, for every count of the milisecond, we light up one of the LEDs and reset
it the moment 10 miliseconds was reached

The issue faced was the miliseconds and seconds synchronizing. We discovered that the seconds timing was exactly 5 miliseconds early during the start phase.
We are unsure why even after looking through the code. Another issue was that we accidentally made out miliseconds count to 11 instead ot 10 before resetting.

2 - Start - Stop function
This function was relatively simple to implement. We just included 2 more buttons and these buttons would control another variable we labeled as state.
This state tells us what state the stop watch is in, start or stop. depending on what that it was in, we would activate or deactivate the 500hz loop.

There was an issue with this where when we stopped / paused the clock. One of the 4 7-segment displays would be on because only 1 anode is on as the 500hz controls
the anodes. Initially we tried letting the board clk control it but it would not properly display the time. To circumvent this, we created another 500hz clk to
control the anodes seperately.
