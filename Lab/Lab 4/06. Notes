Reflection:
I ran into issues trying to convert a single large module into several smaller modules which are technically better.
But Integrating the code was quite tricky, know what to put as input and outputs for each module and ensuring that I do not redeclare any variables.

Creating the start stop function was another challenge, I think there is an issues with debounce or the refresh rate of the start stop button checker.
But essentially, the start stop button when triggered, would not perform its function correctly. Only after increasing the refresh rate of its function
did it finally work more predictably, though not perfectly. 

We then went on to using the RGB lights onboard the CMOD a7 which was rather interesting. For RGB values, we normally would think 0 is off and 255 is
the maximum brightness. But this wasnt the case. It was totally opposite. So in order to say turn on the Blue light, we had to code the LED such that
red if 255, green is 255 and blue is 0. which was a little ounter intuitive.

I personally ran into an issue where the board is operating slower than the expected 12Mhz. I am unsure why this is happening.

Modification:
- Modified from BASYS 3 code
- Added start stop functionality
- Start stop RGB indication light
